Hi I am Sai Vishnu Ramakrishnan,

To run the code, make sure the imput image is in the same project directory. 
If the input image is in different directory, edit the directory path in the code.
Run the "vehicle number plate detection.py" python file to execute the code and the final output will be displayed in the console.
